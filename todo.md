## Features missing
- [ ] "traybar" -- trayer might be a better option than systray patch
- [x] clock in statusbar
- [x] tags with icons instead of numbers
- [ ] wifi indicator
- [ ] tailscale indicator

## Patches to be applied
- [ ] pertag for more flexible layouts
- [ ] transparent statusbar - which should also fix the border issue (border color should be solid and not transparent)
- [ ] round corners (by dwm, so that the border is correctly shown)

## Bugs to be fixed
